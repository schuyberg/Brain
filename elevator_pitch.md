# Develop Your Project Elevator Pitch

### What is an "elevator pitch"?

An elevator pitch is a brief, persuasive speech that you use to spark interest in an organization, project, idea, product or yourself in the time it takes to ride the elevator from the ninth floor to the lobby (20-30 seconds) where the target of your pitch leaves through the lobby and rides away.

Key points of the elevator pitch are to be:
* succinct - stick to key points that will make the most impact
* interesting - what will make your 30 seconds of fame memorable?
* unique - explain what makes your pitch more interesting than anybody else's

There are several different reasons to develop elevator pitches: to obtain funding, bring on a collaborator, get a job.  This pitch is to... 

####A. Compose your message. (10 minutes)

1. Who are you?
2. What are you doing?
3. What is the impact of what you're doing? Why is it important?
4. Identify your hook ... what makes you unique
5. End with your call to action, your "ask".  What are they/you supposed to do next?  Meet with you?  Connect you with their financial person? Respond to your email? 

Now take what you've written down and condense it into 3-4 sentences or less.

####B. Set the tone and review your language. (5 minutes)

De-jargon: Remember Upgoer.
Make it conversational yet professional.  Trying to develop a relationship.
Make sure your message brings out your passion for your project.

####C. Practice, practice, practice. (10 minutes)
Pitch it to each other.

#### Tips for doing this in real life...
* Carry a business card or some other take away so your target a) has something visual by which to remember you and b) they know how to get in touch after the elevator.  (Don't waste precious elevator time trying to write down contact info.)
* Look them in the eye.
